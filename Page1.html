                    <p>In Path of Exile, skills play a crucial role in defining a character's playstyle and combat capabilities. There are two main types of skills: active skills and support skills. Active skills are directly used by the player during gameplay and can be equipped in skill gem sockets on equipment. Each active skill is associated with a specific color (red, green, or blue), representing the attribute requirements needed to use it effectively. As players progress through the game, they can acquire new skill gems through quests, vendors, or drops, allowing them to learn a wide range of abilities, from powerful attacks and spells to defensive maneuvers and utility skills.</p>

                  <div class="col text-center">
                    <p>Support skills, on the other hand, modify active skills when linked together in sockets. Support gems enhance the performance of the active skill they are linked to, offering various benefits such as increased damage, additional projectiles, or improved area of effect. The combination of active and support gems creates unique skill setups, enabling players to fine-tune their character's abilities and create complex and devastating skill rotations. Skill gems can be further augmented through quality improvements, which add bonus effects to the linked skill.</p>

                        <p>One of the most iconic skills as an example in Path of Exile is "Righteous Fire." Righteous Fire is a self-cast spell skill that engulfs the player in a burning aura, dealing fire damage over time to nearby enemies. The skill scales based on the player's maximum life and energy shield, making it particularly potent for characters built around high life or energy shield pools. As the character's life decreases, the damage of Righteous Fire increases, incentivizing players to balance their survivability and damage output carefully. To mitigate the self-inflicted damage from the skill, players often use various life regeneration, life leech, or energy shield recovery mechanisms. Righteous Fire is a popular choice among many players due to its aggressive playstyle and high damage potential, making it effective for both clearing groups of enemies and taking on tough boss encounters.</p>
